###### [Cloth3D](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.cat/dataset/38/description/)
This dataset contains a large collection of synthetic garment data obtained via animation SMPL models wearing different garments. They contain 6 different categories: t-shirt, top, dress, trousers, skirts and jumpsuits; each with different variation in topology such as length of sleeves, torso, legs, distance from body etc.  They also provide UV mapping, allowing one to swap in any desired textures.
